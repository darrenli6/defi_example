 # Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```


# 具体

```
 npx hardhat compile 
```


```
darren@darrendeMacBook-Pro aave_flashloan % npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_flashloan.js --network kovan
myFlashLoan deployed to: 0x1630c96449a4bb0EA2365Fc92Ec0C24302b14274
